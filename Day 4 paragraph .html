<h1>Paragraph</h1>
<p>In this I will tell about 2 different types of paragraph feature one is "line break" and the other one is "pre element"</p>
<p>Line break; In this we use the element 'br' that defines a line break in the sentence in this line will break into 2 parts</p>
<p>this is a line with<br> a line break</p>
<p>Next one is 'pre element' in this this text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks</p>
<pre>
    Morning and evening
    Maids heard the goblins cry:
    “Come buy our orchard fruits,
    Come buy, come buy:
    Apples and quinces,
    Lemons and oranges,
    Plump unpeck’d cherries,
    Melons and raspberries,
    Bloom-down-cheek’d peaches,
    Swart-headed mulberries,
    Wild free-born cranberries,
    Crab-apples, dewberries,
    Pine-apples, blackberries,
    Apricots, strawberries;—
