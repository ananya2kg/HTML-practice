<p>Fourth one is emphasised text in this a screen reader will pronounce the words with an emphasis, using verbal stress. In this we use the tag 'em'.<br> Example:</p>
<em> The text is emphasised </em>
<P> Fifth one is small it defines smaller text. In this we use the tag 'small'.<br> Example:</p>

<p>Next one is subscripted element it defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O.<br> Example:</p>
